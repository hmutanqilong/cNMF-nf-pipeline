# cNMF Nextflow Pipeline

This repository provides a Nextflow implementation of the cNMF pipeline (originally built with Snakemake).

It is derived from the following projects: cNMF (https://github.com/dylkot/cNMF) and cNMF_pipeline (https://github.com/EngreitzLab/cNMF_pipeline).

**Prerequisites:**

 - Nextflow ≥ 24.10.6

 - The cNMF package for Python 3

The environment definition for cNMF is available in the cNMF_installation/ directory.
